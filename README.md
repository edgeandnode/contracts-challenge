# Smart Contract Challenge (#2)

## A) Challenge 1

### Setup a project and create a contract

ETHPool provides a service where people can deposit ETH and they will receive weekly rewards. Users must be able to take out their deposits along with their portion of rewards at any time. New rewards are deposited into the pool by the ETHPool team each week (i.e. it is a trusted setup).

Design and code a contract for ETHPool, take all the assumptions you need to move forward.

You can use any development tools you prefer: Hardhat, Truffle, Brownie, Solidity, Vyper.

Useful resources:
- Solidity Docs: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.4
- Educational Resource: https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth
- Project Starter: https://github.com/abarmat/solidity-starter

### Deploy your contract

Deploy the contract to any Ethereum testnet of your preference. Keep record of the deployed address.

Bonus:
- Verify the contract in Etherscan

### Interact with the contract

Create a script (or a Hardhat task) to query the total amount of ETH held in the contract.

You can use any library you prefer: Ethers.js, Web3.js, Web3.py, eth-brownie

## B) Challenge 2

### Create a subgraph

Create a subgraph that index the main events of the contract from the first challenge into entities as you see convenient. For example, it would be great to query all user deposits into the contract.

## Setup and organization

You can work on a private GitHub repo and then share it with ariel@edgeandnode.com and david@edgeandnode.com
